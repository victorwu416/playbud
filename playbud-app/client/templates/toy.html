          Playbud is designed specifically for your child to play with the Toys R Us Bruin Stack 'n Sort Giraffe toy.
          Each toy-based skill has been carefully developed based on scientific child-development milestones.
          This allows your child to track against these milestones, but in a novel, play-based manner,
          which medical research tells us is the best way for a child to learn, grow, and develop at a young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose this toy specifically because it is flexible enough for a wide range of play skills in the areas of motor, cognitive, and social/emotional development,
          with these play skills spanning over 24 months where they are appropriate for your child.
